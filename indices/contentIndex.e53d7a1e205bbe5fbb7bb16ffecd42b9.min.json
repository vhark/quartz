{"/":{"title":"ðŸŒ´ Vince's Digital Garden","content":"\nWelcome to my first foray into public domain second brains. I'm starting with uploading my notes and writing here with the intention of creating another tool that syncs and federates other public domain second brains. A [[notes/second brain|second brain]] or [[notes/digital garden|digital garden]] of networked thought is just a collection of notes, articles, lists etc. that are linked to other relevant notes by the author, it makes for a fascinating way to see the relationships between thoughts in addition to providing a multifaceted view of subject and author.\n\n## [[notes/Start with Why|Start with Why]]\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[]},"/notes/5-Whys":{"title":"5 Whys","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/Grownetics":{"title":"Grownetics","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/Lean-Manufacturing":{"title":"Lean Manufacturing","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/Simon-Sinek":{"title":"@Simon Sinek","content":"\nAuthor and speaker who's book [[notes/Start with Why|Start with Why]] ","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/Start-with-Why":{"title":"Start with Why","content":"\nAs [[notes/@Simon Sinek|@Simon Sinek]] says, \"Start with Why\". This simple yet powerful statement gets to the root of our motivations and readily encompasses values, mission, and impact goals with clarity and simplicity. It reminds me of the book [[notes/The Toyota Way|The Toyota Way]] in which a key technique to help root cause analysis is to ask Why 5 times, recognizing that our first response is often not the root cause but rather a habituated response from our default mode, whether that be one of defensiveness or over-assuredness in the context of the question. This technique is also known as the [[notes/5 Whys|5 Whys]] in [[notes/Lean Manufacturing|Lean Manufacturing]].\n\nFor example if I want to do a root cause analysis on \n\n1. why I am writing and publishing my [[notes/second brain|second brain]]  my first instinct is to say\n\t1. Because I am passionate about [[notes/open innovation|open innovation]] and collaborative problem solving, especially when it comes to making a [[notes/collective impact|collective impact]] by changing the status quo.\n2. Why am I passionate about open innovation and collaborative problem solving for impact and change?\n\t1. Because I've realized the traditional development model is inherently inefficient and flawed. It engenders a lot of duplicate work and wasted economic cycles. This is especially true in physical products. \n3. Why are traditional development models inherently inefficient and flawed? \n\t1. Because people, institutions, and companies invest a great deal of time and money into bringing innovative products and solutions to market and if they remain silo'd and buried after the company or institution fails to deliver for reasons other than product/market fit (i.e. market timing issue, unforeseen obstacle, personel issues, etc.) then all that time, skilled labor, and capital in developing what very well may be a life changing product have essentially been artificially buried for the sake of greed, \"if I can't make money of it, then no one can.\"\n4. Why do people, institution, and companies continue to develop products this way despite the clear inefficiency in moving the human race and society forward?\n\t1. It's the best we've got so far (communism proved true selfless governance with the community in mind was unrealistic due to power corrupting those who were given decision making authority). It's the foundation of the dominant global economic model which is 'free market' economics. Based on rewarding an individuals or group of peoples greed and self preservation instincts by allowing them to own and prevent intellectual property from being used by others for their mutual benefit ensuring consolidated profits in the hands of the patent holder.\n5. Why is this the foundation of the dominant global economic model? \n\t1. Because the US won WWII and exported US economic policy through lending which lead to a global empire of US interests and propaganda channels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a there are many other means to accomplish this, for example a blog or newsletter could accomplish this. If I ask why a second time, to probe further, my second instinct is to say: \n\n2. Because I've found tremendous value out of the things I'd like to share and if I don't share my learnings and findings they're almost pointless. I find value in the sharing of the distilled knowledge I've gained. If I can save someone else the time needed to retrace the path I've already taken then I am inevitably improving the efficiency (however minor) of our collective problem solving abilities. \n\nIf I ask why a third time, I have to now begin mining other possibilities, I begin questioning my first two statements to validate, or invalidate them. My third response to why I am writing and publishing my second brain is: \n\n3. The visual display of text through hyperlinks with network visuals that reflect the interconnectedness of thoughts more accurately represents the way I see the world. As a nonhierarchical tapestry of relationships and contexts that essentially go on forever. The networked notes and corresponding visuals also add a layer of context for the reader, more accurately reflecting the mental models of the author. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/The-Toyota-Way":{"title":"The Toyota Way","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":["",""]},"/notes/Welcome":{"title":"Welcome","content":"\nWelcome to my home on the web where I will be sharing notes and thoughts on subjects.","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/building-a-second-brain":{"title":"building a second brain-BASB","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/collective-impact":{"title":"collective impact","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/digital-garden":{"title":"digital garden","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/open-innovation":{"title":"open innovation","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/personal-knowledge-management":{"title":"personal knowledge management","content":"\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.047845767Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/second-brain":{"title":"second brain","content":"\nThe need for a second brain or [[notes/zettelkasten|zettelkasten]] began after I attempted my yearly review and found myself at a loss to manage the complexity and changes that had been accumulating from my learnings since starting [[Grownetics]] and watching the regulated [[cannabis]] market evolve. \n","lastmodified":"2023-07-24T22:38:39.051845801Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/zettelkasten":{"title":"zettelkasten","content":"\nA Zettelkasten or card file consists of small items of information stored on paper slips or cards that may be linked to each other through subject headings or other metadata such as numbers and tags.
