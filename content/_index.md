Welcome to my first foray into public domain second brains. I'm starting with uploading my notes and writing here with the intention of creating another tool that syncs and federates other public domain second brains. A [[second brain]] or [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) of networked thought is just a collection of notes, articles, lists etc. that are linked hyper linked by the author, it makes for a fascinating way to see the relationships between thoughts in addition to providing a multifaceted view of a subject.

That's it for now. Just testing the waters.
